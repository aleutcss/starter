/**
 * RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS
 * This is where we define all our breakpoints. It overwrites https://github.com/aleutcss/settings.responsive
 * These also generate helper-classes with aleut that we can use:
 * f.ex: u-1/2@lap (for width), u-pt@lap(for padding-top on lap-size) etc.
 * See all alternatives in https://github.com/aleutcss/utilities.spacing-responsive and
 * utilities.widths-responsive.
 *
 * We can also use them with a media-query mixin like this:
 * Usage:
 *  @include media-query(palm) {
 *
 *  }
